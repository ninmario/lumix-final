        "question": "Describe MGH DAO in one line",
        "answer": "MGH DAO is fostering the convergence of the metaverse, NFTs, AI and DeFi by building an ecosystem of NFT curation and applying DeFi tools to allow fractionalized access to this ever growing market which is lacking transparency." 
    },
    {
        "question": "What is Metagamehub DAO developing and why does the world need it?",
        "answer": "The MGH DAO develops a platform which enables the access to decentralized NFT pools and NFT Pool Tokens (synthetic assets tracking the pool value) and thus enhancing the value factor of NFTs without the sacrifice of ownership for NFT holders. Furthermore, MGH DAO will provide a sophisticated AI-based oracle that allows the analysis of the respective NFTs fair value and seamless, transparent integration into the NFT Pool. Community members can stake their NFTs and MGH tokens to generate passive income (network rewards for NFT staking) while participating in the governance of the ecosystem that is 1) the DeFi and AI tools and 2) the NFTs owned directly by the DAO itself. The NFT staking is an important factor for us as we want to support the allocation of value while protecting the ownership. The initial focus will be on metaverse related NFTs as this evolving market has some of the most auspicious NFTs there are out there (e.g. LANDS).\n\nWhy does the world need this? In a nutshell we have defined the following pain points thus far which will be jettisoned by the MGH DAO model:\n\n1. Intransparent and sole emotional decision making when purchasing an NFT\n2. Lack of utility for NFTs other than “hodling” them\n3. Enormous prices of valuable NFTs are making it hard for retail investors to participate in this industry other than buying cheap NFTs that may not be worth anything - NPTs allow possibility to participate in value increase of this industry\n4. Collaborative governance of NFT pools allow better diversification and access also for inexperienced investors to the knowledge of “Crypto OGs” that stake their NFTs in a pool\n5. DeFi is a hype, NFTs are a hype, the metaverse is a hype, DAOs are a hype, AI is a hype, Oracle are a hype. Often projects focus on only one of these aspects. We provide convergence and a holistic ecosystem aimed at sustainable growth.\n6. Often - even in crypto - teams are regionally located. We are not. We have members actively participating from Ghana, Colombia, Germany, Japan, USA, Australia, Vietnam, South Africa, Mexico, Spain, Turkey, Tunisia, Switzerland and more. This diversity allows us to really be on par with the global vision of decentralized organizational structures and therefore truly being a DAO."

        "question": "What is the Metagamehub DAO backstory? What led you to the idea?",
        "answer": "We come from different backgrounds and since we are already 40+ members more or less actively contributing to fostering the MGH DAO it would be hard to tell everyone’s story of course. However it all started with some of the founders having conversations with visionary founders of e.g. game developers, metaverse ecosystems, NFT projects and more where the above mentioned pain points became evident. Moreover we realized that the true potential of NFTs is far from being unlocked. We then did thorough research of the market and defined the core principle of MGH which initially focused more on a DAO owning and curating LANDS in the metaverse. Though we felt like this was not enough. We wanted to provide a holistic ecosystem that values transparency as we saw that often the price of metaverse based assets such as the LANDS sales in e.g. The Sandbox does not allow small investors to participate and also there is often no transparency as to why some LANDS sell for such high prices. Still we very much believed in the long term potential. This is how we came up with the idea of the AI-based price oracle as we did not want our DAO to acquire overvalued LANDS. Now our thirst for further improvement and evolution was awakened.\n\nWe also in this time identified that generally for retail it is really difficult to take part in the NFT market and by applying our DeFi strategy with the NFT Pools and NFT Pool Tokens, we want to change that. The MGH DAO proposes a solution that centers the true value of an NFT in a disruptive way. It is important to gradually venture into different pockets in which NFTs thrive so as to accurately determine and evaluate the longevity of each pool. This way we avoid the gross overgeneralization of NFTs which is one of the deciding factors when determining the add a realistic price analysis. The power of this based solution bridges the gap between DeFi and NFTs in a way that allows everyday people to participate in the market in a more transparent and accessible way.\n\nAnother main problem that the metaverse currently faces is the lack of liquidity for NFTs. This affects the viability and sustainability of the projects that issue them and makes them unattractive to many investors. At their current stage of development, it is very common for virtual land and other NFTs to be auctioned on marketplaces for several days before being sold. With this issue in mind, we further came up with the idea of gradually expanding the NFT ecosystem from the metaverse to artists, sports collectible, IP and more which will make up further pools in the future."

        "question": "What’s unique about Metagamehub? Why has nobody managed to solve the problem that we tackle?",
        "answer": "What is unique is for one our diverse and ambitious team. It is a very heterogeneous group. Additionally, the beforehand mentioned convergence of the metaverse, AI, oracles, DeFi, DAOs and NFTs in a holistic, coherent and sophisticated approach is something that singles us out. Sure these are a lot of “buzzwords” but we strongly believe that we can deliver due to the astonishing amount of members as well as investors that already believe in us - raising ca. USD 800,000 with marketing costs of around USD 4,000 speaks for itself we believe. As the emergence of this entire space has barely been in the past few years, the problems also have only recently become evident. This is why we believe that we are one of the first to actually proactively address them. Often projects only focus on creating a tool for a niche, funding it with a token. To us it is important that we build a sustainable model of leveraging the powers of a DAO, DeFi and oracles for the evolution of NFTs and the metaverse."

        "question": "How will the MGH DAO make money?",
        "answer": "As a DAO, MGH provides an ecosystem for members to generate revenue through the value provided by their MGH tokens and NFTs. This innovative approach is a community first set up and focuses on the convergence of governance of NFT pools that in turn provide a self-sustaining value chain. Hence the first income stream are network rewards for providing resources to the DAO. Furthermore, creating synergies between the different revenue streams will allow MGH to protect and increase its value in the long-term. For example, the MGH DAO will purchase different metaverse assets that are held by the MGH DAO treasury and controlled by the community members. These assets will create revenue by e.g. renting out LANDS or perpetual royalty models for IP. In the case of metaverse land, members can vote on game development which will open up more passive income streams. To facilitate this, the MGH DAO has partnered with MyReailty DAO which is a Game Developer that specializes on the metaverse.\n\nHaving the possibility to integrate multiple use cases of virtual land ownership, will harness diverse revenue stream possibilities which include but are not limited to royalties, brand placement revenue and event hosting. In addition to that, MGH DAO will let the community vote on 1) a scarce avatar series called “Meta” and 2) by-monthly unique NFT sales by a selected community artist of MGH DAO. These sales will further provide revenue to the DAO treasury which will generally aim to be an active participant in the MGH DAO ecosystem by providing resources (e.g. staking NFTs, MGH) for earning network rewards."

    {
        "question": "Why is the MGH core team best suited to develop this business?",
        "answer": "Our team is made up of Blockchain Enthusiasts and Architects, Game Developers, Legal Professionals, Tech innovators and Creatives. Above all we believe in a blockchain powered future that frees us from the oppressive mindstate of secrecy and inefficient corporate structures. The MGH DAO is our first project together that signifies the first step to innovative new approaches as a team. Due to our diverse and heterogeneous backgrounds we can have the most objective approach possible to the DAO we are building. We are able to keep each other in check, analyze neutrally and perfectly allocate someone’s resources where they feel most comfortable in as we have no shortages of talent." 
    },
    {
        "question": "How do the founders know each other? What is the team relationship like? How is conflict resolved?",
        "answer": "We are a group of like minded individuals with unique strengths and abilities. What unites us is the passion for innovation that affects global development. The digital realm has always been inviting to people that think outside the box. We were all drawn in to merge our talents and compensate for each other's weakness while providing direction to each other's strengths.\n\nOur relationship is that the core team has become like a family working together and currently in the process of renting a house together in Portugal to foster the most efficient and dynamic work environment possible. We push each other harder than we have ever been pushed to achieve something we believe will change the future and serve as a blueprint for the industry. Blockchain technology means freedom to us. By creating a solution that provides access while being transparent and community focused, we are taking the right steps to expand the evolution of Web 3.0.\n\nWe are a team that encourages individualism, yet fosters an organic development of team spirit. Though it has its perks it also means now and then friction arises. We solve this by open and honest communication. We also encourage a flat hierarchy yet have made provision for authority for the purpose of direction, motivation and clarity. We have designated a protocol to maintain a uniform understanding on the current standing which includes multiple weekly sync calls to create and optimize our outlook and give everyone the chance to be heard."

    {
        "question": "What is the team missing?",
        "answer": "We are fortunate to have a full functioning team with many of the core team working 24/7 on the project. Even though there are some members that work full time jobs, are full time students or both, they are highly motivated and spend every hour they can spare investing their resources into making this venture successful. This also allowed us to function cost effectively. Generally a DAO strives from community contributions and here we have every member of the team spending a minimum of 15 hours a week on turning the MGH DAO into a self-sufficient ecosystem.\n\nOur next round of “hiring” would focus on expanding our Tech team. This is actually already in progress right now as we are hiring AI devs from Columbia to help work on the AI-based price oracle. We want to be as efficient and innovative as time allows us to be, so having more talented developers on our team will give us the freedom to continue to expand our ideas and implement them in a timely manner."

        "question": "Who's leading the fundraising?",
        "answer": "The fundraising is more or less decentralized across the globe where members raise funds in their own ecosystems to collaboratively foster progress. Raising funds from VCs and such is mainly falling into the hands of Jeanine Feierfeil (Blockchain enthusiast, Business Consultant and award nominated artist), Camilo Echeverri (Business Analyst, Blockchain Entrepreneur and DeFi architect) and Nicolas Weber (Co-Founder Tokenization Working Group at the European Blockchain Association, Founding team and Head of BD at Amazing Blocks AG, Blockchain Consultant since 4+ years)." 
    },
    {
        "question": "What are people doing now instead of using MGH solutions?",
        "answer": "Unfortunately, people depend on luck, timing, extensive research and emotions to gauge which NFT is worth collecting and then debate on the best time to sell said NFT to benefit from its value. There is no real transparency on the value of an NFT which we want to solve one NFT class at a time. Metaverse related NFTs play a big role in the future of NFT adaptation. Virtual reality is to mimic real life experiences and unlock a new level of gaming which will have to depend on the properties of an NFT for accurate data history. This will give NFTs an even more important role in the future. As the use cases explode, we have to rethink how more value can be extracted from NFTs without necessarily losing ownership in a transparent and fair way.\n\nWith our ecosystem we give people the opportunity to grow the value of their carefully curated NFTs. The AI tool in development will also determine the price of what is to be entered into the MGH pools which will provide members of the community with real data backing the price of NFTs.\n\nFurthermore, people solely hold their NFT in the hopes of selling it for more at a later stage rather than actually earning passive income with it and putting it to use. That's a bit like just having a famous painting in the basement while you could rent it to galleries/exhibitions. Also, everyone is trying alone to curate and obtain LANDS, the power relies in community and collaboratively merging resources." 
    },
    {
        "question": "Who are your direct competitors? Why are you better?",
        "answer": "After extensive research we have not been able to determine a true competitor. The diversity we provide is truly unique. Sure there are some NFT-Collector DAOs, but they do not have the oracle and DeFi aspects. Also sure, there are projects like Whale or NFTX that aim for the DeFi - NFT convergence. However they are lacking 1) the oracle and 2) the active community also governing NFTs collaboratively.\n\nThis unique blend takes care of its network while accelerating towards Web 3.0.The AI tool will also ensure the community will not be dependent on the emotions of the market when considering to expose themselves to the network rewards triggered when staking their Metaverse related NFT. The aim is to expand on the selection of the NFTs in the future as providing transparent accessibility to NFTs is our goal as we do not find this to be the case in the current market." 
    },
    {
        "question": "What makes MGH different from other projects? What is out moat?",
        "answer": "We are building our own NFT price analysis tool, secured a partnership to develop games and NFTs and work with advisors who were not only co-founders in successful blockchain businesses, but also were an integral part of creating the Sandbox metaverse. As much as our tool can be used to determine the value of NFTs, we are also focused on actively being part of the advancement of different metaverses by continuing to acquire and cultivating prime virtual real estate. Nevertheless in the open-source space forks and copies can always be made, there is no protection on that. But this is okay to us as we see our already strong community - that is active members not necessarily only social media followers (proof can be provided) as our strongest weapon and differentiation to others wanting to copy us - which they can but they cannot (yet) copy the minds behind the project and that foster the contributing community." 
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the biggest assumption in the business?",
        "answer": "NFTs are going to be even more disruptive in the future, the ability to track ownership with the issuance of non fungible tokens allows for a more transparent and trustworthy system. Hence the biggest assumption is that we strongly believe in the future of NFTs and them being a crucial part of the metaverse and other ecosystems." 
    },
    {
        "question": "How are you tracking progress currently? What is the one metric you use to track progress or success now?",
        "answer": "To keep the team motivated and organized, we hold weekly 1on1s to touch base on mindstate and mark progress. As well as weekly meetings for each department to align and delegate tasks. Founding members also have their weekly meetings to stay aligned.\n\nWe believe in protecting our individual growth as much as the growth of the team. We pride ourselves in flat hierarchies which is essential for a DAO to truly function at its best. We use tools provided by Google, Airtable, Notion, Hubspot, Calendly, Canva etc to be organized and structured while enjoying the flexibility of working remotely.\n\nEach department holds itself accountable and naturally keeps the ball rolling. We have also implemented a bounty system in each department for team members that work on a task basis. The structure is as follows: Each task is assigned bounties for being completed before deadline, right on deadline and after deadline. There are also extra bounties for finding new approaches and implementing new ideas. New processes are documented and shared so we always are up to date."

    {
        "question": "What are your key metrics showing in terms of numbers?",
        "answer": "As we are in the early stages and a DAO the answer may differ a bit from “traditional” models:\n\n1. We have thus far raised ca. USD 800,000 from early contributors / members from all over the world with “only” investing around USD 4,000 within a two month period in legal documents, marketing, Hubspot etc. - an ambitious, motivated team is everything\n2. We have already various sub-communities especially in the Japanese market: A Line Chat with more than 1,300 members, a Twitter channel MGH DAO Japan with 1,000 followers and various other promotions on e.g. YouTube.\n3. We have our standard accounts on LinkedIn (currently rolling out), Medium, Telegram (ca. 400 members as we have a strict bot protection), Instagram and Twitter with the following metrics:\n\n146K impressions - 89.6% increase over the past 30 days\n17.9K profile visits - 73.5% increase over the past 30 days\n506 mentions - 787.7% increase over the past 30 days\n833 followers - 579% increase over the past 30 days\n\n1. We have a proactive team of regular contributors of around 40 people across the globe.\n2. We have compiled a list of 11,000 selected blockchain contacts that we will gradually reach out to in order to expand our ecosystem.\n3. We have already (without any token issuance to investors) 52 unique token holders which represent the early members of our community - first batch to investors will be issued on the 28th of July - here we have over 100 single investors already contributing anywhere between USD 100 - USD 100,000.\n\n(JULY)"

        "question": "How are we planning to approach customer acquisition?",
        "answer": "As we are a DAO we do not have a traditional path to “customer acquisition”. The aim is to foster a community that collaboratively governs NFT pools and makes key decisions in regards to the future of the MGH DAO. By providing the structure, implementing innovative solutions and encouraging partnership we aim to become a self-sustaining ecosystem."
